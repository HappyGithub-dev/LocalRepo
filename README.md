Created a simple object detection model on google colab . 
Main concepts involved were : Image Reading and highlighting important object features using rectangles . 
A file called coco.names was imported as it contained the names of various objects and the names were stored in a list . 
A Neural Network was introduced in order to introduce the scale factor and swap the color scale of the image . 
Lastly the rectangle was initialised which would detect the object ( in this case human ) with its 2 diagonal ends .
